# Sentiment Analysis for RadzWorld!

## 📖 Project Overview

In today’s digital marketplace, customers don’t just buy—they speak. They leave behind star ratings, detailed reviews, and candid feedback. But with millions of reviews across a wide array of products, the true voice of the customer often gets lost in the noise.

This project aims to extract meaningful sentiment insights from product reviews across various categories (e.g., Electronics, Home & Kitchen, Fashion), allowing businesses and product teams to understand not just **how many stars** a product gets—but **why**.

## 🧠 Business Case: Making Sense of the Stars

Imagine an internal analytics division within a major e-commerce platform tasked with a pressing challenge:

> “Can we understand what customers feel—not just what they rate—about the products they buy?”

While star ratings offer surface-level signals, the rich text in customer reviews holds the deeper truths: delight, frustration, trust, or betrayal. A single sentiment phrase can explain what thousands of numeric ratings cannot.

The **Sentiment Analysis** project is designed to bridge that gap—transforming raw, unstructured text into actionable insights.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Classify Sentiment Polarity**: Detect whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Identify Common Themes**: Extract topics and frequent keywords associated with sentiment (e.g., “battery life,” “packaging,” “customer support”).
- **Monitor Trends Over Time**: Spot changes in sentiment due to updates, launches, or service shifts.
- **Visualize Results**: Provide charts and dashboards to communicate findings clearly to non-technical stakeholders.
